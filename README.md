# WoW MyStats Addon

Addon I created in May of 2009 when I was 15.

Creates a window frame allowing a player to view their current stats, and will show stat differences when equipment is changed or buffs/debuffs are applied.

Every other file in this repo is the original file I uploaded as the last version to WoW Interface.

Addon had 1,770 downloads.
